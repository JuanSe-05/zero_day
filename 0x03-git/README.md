Git vs. GitHub: What's the Difference?

Given that coding relies so heavily on exact syntax, the naming convention surrounding programming languages and resources is anything but intuitive. Java and JavaScript are about as closely related as ham and hamster, and Python’s logo may be an image of intertwined snakes, but it’s actually named after the Monty Python sketch comedy group. HTML and CSS are acronyms that describe what the code actually is or does (HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets, respectively), while C++ describes its origins. And that’s only scratching the surface.

So, for someone first hearing about Git vs. GitHub, the apparent connection may not be quite so apparent.
